# Foco -> Focus on what matters. One day at a time.

Solving complex problems is hard. It requires your undivided attention. It requires from you to focus your entire self on the problem. Foco, will help you achieve such goals by gamifying your focus experience. Focus on what matters. One day at a time.

[Work in Progress]()

## MVP RoadMap

Our web app will consist of a lean Minimum Viable Product that will provide users with the possibility to gamify their working experience by staying focus on their work. In return, their avatars will be able to perform important tasks on their farms and move forward. 

The user will be able to perform the following actions:
- Create an account with a secure password
- Create an avatar with basic options
- Choose a task to perform and commit to a specific time slot to perform such task. 
  - Available tasks:
    - Plant a crop
    - Maintain a crop
    - Harvest a crop
- Once finished, the user will get a report with the outcome. Depending on the outcome his/her avatar will succeed in the mentioned tasks.
- The user will see how their farm has evolved over time depending on the number of tasks succesfully completed.

## Built With

- Ruby v2.7
- Ruby on Rails v6.0.3.2
